**Introduction**

Globally, breast cancer is the leading invasive cancer among women. It accounts for nearly one-quarter of invasive cancers in women worldwide, and one-sixth of all female cancers.\[1]

This research focuses on identifying the multi-omic features associated with breast cancer therapy response, emphasizing on the need to build machine learning models to predict pathology end points of cytotoxic therapy. \[2]

The objective of the research is to develop and validate a machine learning model that can accurately predict the pathological complete response (PCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a critical outcome for breast cancer patients.

**Methodology**

- The study assembled a large and diverse cohort of breast cancer patients, ensuring a representative sample for model development and validation.
- Multi-omic data collection was employed to capture comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic information from tumor samples. Additionally, digital pathology techniques were used to analyze tumor morphology and cellular composition.
- The researchers also extracted tumor mutational burden, immune cell infiltration, and gene expression signatures associated with tumor biology and treatment response, from the multi-omic data.
- A gradient boosting algorithm was selected for model development, known for its ability to handle complex relationships and non-linear interactions within the data.

**Results**

The developed model demonstrated superior performance in predicting predicted a pathological complete response (pCR) compared to existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.87 in an external validation cohort. This indicates that the model can accurately differentiate between patients who are likely to achieve PCR and those who are less likely to respond to treatment.

In addition, the model identified several key features that contributed significantly to its predictive power. These features included tumor mutational burden, immune cell infiltration, and gene expression signatures related to T-cell dysfunction. These findings provide valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying treatment response.

The research also suggests that the developed model could be used to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, potentially leading to more personalized treatment decisions and improved patient outcomes.

**Conclusion**

The challenges of the study include the sample size and the applicability of the findings to different patient populations. However, the authors claim that the model's performance and the identified key features will likely apply to a broader range of breast cancer patients.

It is recommended that the model should be expanded to include additional clinical and molecular features, exploring its applicability to other cancer types, and investigating the potential for real-world implementation in clinical practice.
